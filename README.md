# langchain101
Materials for the company internal tech-talk where I'll walk the team through basics of langchain repo usage. Everything is very simple and limited because I'd like to go through most of it in the 45 min talk.

Most of the code is adapted from other repos or courses, links to original source of code is in each notebook.

Short notebooks included in repo:
- How to set up interactions with OpenAI

  _I don't have a paid plan so I can't really play with it now but including here as it's the most popular tool_
  
- How to set up interactions with AnthropicAI (Claude)
  
- How to start playing with plugins & agents using AnthropicAI (Claude)

  _That's the most fun one, I think!_
