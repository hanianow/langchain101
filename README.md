# langchain101
Materials for the company internal tech-talk where I'll walk the team through very basics of langchain repo usage

Main inspiration is the course by Andrew Ng and as a starting point I'll be taking the notebook from there, see:
https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/lesson/2/models,-prompts-and-parsers

Generally, most of the content here won't be mine, there is so much good stuff out there already, I won't come up with anything better!
